# WebCheck

My first project with PHP, don't judge. 

This script will check for website status.

Installation:
Drag index.php & check.php to your desired directory.

Recaptcha setup:
<br>
1. Go to http://google.com/recaptcha, login. Verify your domain.
<br>
2. Look for an dropdown arrow which says "Keys". Click it.
<br>
3. In index.php on line 37, enter your site key where it says.
<br>
4. On line 73 in index.php, enter your secret.
<br>
5. All done!!

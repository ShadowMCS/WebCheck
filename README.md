# WebCheck

My first project with PHP, don't judge. 

This script will check for website status.

Installation:
Drag index.php & check.php to your desired directory.

Recaptcha setup:

1. Go to http://google.com/recaptcha and login. Verify your domain.
2. Look for an dropdown arrow which says "Keys". Click it.
3. In index.php on line 37, enter your site key where it says.
4. On line 73 in index.php, enter your secret.
5. All done.
